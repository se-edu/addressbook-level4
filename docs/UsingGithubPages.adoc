https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages] is a static site hosting service that allows users to publish webpages using files in their GitHub repositories.

== Setting Up

GitHub Pages offers two kinds of sites: user/organization sites and project sites. Since we are using GitHub Pages to showcase the documentation for our project, we will be creating a project site.

1.  Navigate to the repository's `Settings` tab in GitHub.

2.  Under the GitHub Pages section, click `Choose a theme` in `Theme chooser`. Pick a theme for the project site and click `Select theme` when done.
3.  You can now view the site at `https://<username-or-organization-name>.github.io/<repo-name>`. e.g. `https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4`

Note that the publishing source has been automatically set to `master branch`. This means that the GitHub Pages site will be published using source files in the `master` branch. Jekyll, a static site generator integrated with GitHub Pages, automatically renders asciidoc files (in the `master` branch) to HTML, which are then deployed to the project site by GitHub Pages.

== Viewing the Project Site

The project site URL follows the format `https://<username-or-organization-name>.github.io/<repo-name>`, e.g. `https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4`. By default, the <<../README#, README>> file is displayed on this page.

For the other pages, the structure of the site follows the structure of the repository. For example, `docs/UserGuide.adoc` is published at `https://<username-or-organization-name>.github.io/addressbook-level4/docs/UserGuide.html`.

== Updating the Project Site

To update the project site, simply edit the documentation files in asciidoc and push the changes to GitHub. GitHub Pages automatically updates the project site when changes are committed to the `master` branch (e.g. when the commit is pushed to the `master` branch or when the pull request containing the commit is merged into `master`).

== Customizing the Project Site

For instructions on customizing the project site, refer to https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/[GitHub's guides].
