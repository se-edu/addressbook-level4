= Using GitHub Pages
:imagesDir: images

https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages] is a static site hosting service
that allows users to publish webpages using files in their GitHub
repositories.

== Setting Up

GitHub Pages offers two kinds of sites: user/organization sites and
project sites. Since we are using GitHub Pages to showcase the
documentation for our project, we will be creating a project site.

.  Navigate to the repository's `Settings` tab in GitHub.

.  Under the GitHub Pages section, click `Choose a theme` in
`Theme chooser`. Pick a theme for the project site and click
`Select theme` when done.
.  You can now view the site at
`https://<username-or-organization-name>.github.io/<repo-name>`. e.g.
`https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4`

Note that the publishing source has been automatically set to
`master branch`. This means that the GitHub Pages site will be published
using source files in the `master` branch. Jekyll, a static site
generator integrated with GitHub Pages, automatically renders Markdown
files (in the `master` branch) to HTML, which are then deployed to the
project site by GitHub Pages.

== Viewing the Project Site

The project site URL follows the format
`https://<username-or-organization-name>.github.io/<repo-name>`, e.g.
`https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4`. By default, the
link:../README.md[README] file is displayed on this page.

For the other pages, the structure of the site follows the structure of
the repository. For example, `docs/UserGuide.md` is published at
`https://<username-or-organization-name>.github.io/addressbook-level4/docs/UserGuide.html`.

== Updating the Project Site

To update the project site, simply edit the documentation files in
Markdown and push the changes to GitHub. GitHub Pages automatically
updates the project site when changes are committed to the `master`
branch (e.g. when the commit is pushed to the `master` branch or when
the pull request containing the commit is merged into `master`).

== Customizing the Project Site

For instructions on customizing the project site, refer to
https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/[GitHub's
guides].

== Troubleshooting

*Problem: Markdown is not displayed properly in GitHub Pages even though
they appear correctly in GitHub preview*

* Reason: Jekyll (which converts Markdown to HTML for GitHub Pages) uses
kramdown as its markdown engine but GitHub preview uses GitHub's own
markdown engine. Since kramdown requires stricter syntax than GitHub's
markdown engine, a Markdown file might be rendered correctly in GitHub
preview but not on GitHub Pages.
* Solution: Make sure you have followed the
https://oss-generic.github.io/process/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Gfmd.html[coding
standard] for GitHub Flavored Markdown. If the problem persists, try
checking https://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/gfm.html[kramdown's
syntax] to see if you are using the correct syntax for GitHub Pages.
