https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] is a web service that tracks code coverage over time for GitHub projects.
Coveralls requires Travis CI to be set up beforehand as Travis sends the coverage report from the latest build to Coveralls.
If you have not set up Travis CI, see <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>>. Currently, Coveralls supports Travis CI but not AppVeyor.

== Setting up Coveralls

.  Go to https://coveralls.io/ and click `SIGN IN`. Then click `GITHUB SIGN IN` and enter your GitHub account details if needed.
+
.  After logging in, you will be brought to the `Your Repositories` page. On the site's navigation bar, click https://coveralls.io/repos/new[ADD REPOS].
+
.  Find the switch for the forked repository.
* If the organization is not shown, click `GITHUB SETTINGS` as shown below:

+
This should bring you to a GitHub page that manages the access of third-party applications. Depending on whether you are the owner of the repository, you can either grant access
+

+
or request access

+
to Coveralls so that it can access your repository.
* If your repository cannot be found, click `SYNC REPOS`.

== Disabling Coveralls Automatic Comments on Pull Requests

Coveralls automatically comments on the coverage status of the pull requests in GitHub. If it's a hindrance, you can disable it in the settings of your project in Coveralls:

.  Click `Settings`.
+
.  Uncheck the `LEAVE COMMENTS?` checkbox. Then click `SAVE CHANGES`.
