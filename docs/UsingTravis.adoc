= Travis CI

https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] is a _Continuous Integration_ platform
for GitHub projects.

Travis CI can run the projects' tests automatically whenever new code is
pushed to the repo. This ensures that existing functionality and
features have not been broken by the changes.

The current Travis CI set up performs the following things whenever
someone push code to the repo:

* Runs the `./gradlew clean headless allTests coverage coveralls asciidoctor -i`
command (see UsingGradle.md for more details on what this command
means).
* Automatically retries the build up to 3 times if a task fails.
* Runs additional <<repository-wide-checks, repository-wide checks>>.
* Deploys generated HTML files and other necessary files (images, stylesheets)
 to `gh-pages` branch for commits to the `master` branch.

If you would like to customise your travis build further, you can learn
more about Travis from https://docs.travis-ci.com/[Travis CI Documentation].

== Setting up Travis CI

. Fork the repo to your own organization.
. Go to https://travis-ci.org/ and click `Sign in with GitHub`, then
enter your GitHub account details if needed.

. Head to the https://travis-ci.org/profile[Accounts] page, and find
the switch for the forked repository.
.. If the organization is not shown, click `Review and add` as shown
below: image:images/review_and_add.png[Review and add] +
This should bring you to a GitHub page that manages the access of third-party
applications. Depending on whether you are the owner of the repository,
you can either grant access image:images/grant_access.png[Grant Access]
or request access image:images/request_access.png[Request Access] +
to Travis CI so that it can access your commits and build your code.
.. If repository cannot be found, click `Sync account`
. Activate the switch. +

. On Github, generate a personal access token https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[here].
+
image::images/generate_token.png
+
.. Add a description for the token (e.g. `Travis CI - Asciidoc to gh-pages`)
.. Check the `public_repo` checkbox. 
.. Click `Generate Token` and copy your new personal access token.
. On Travis, go to the project page and click on the `settings` tab and
 add a new environment variable with 
+
* name: `GH_TOKEN`
* value: copied personal access token
+
[WARNING]
====
Make sure you set `Display value in build log` to `OFF`. 
Otherwise, other people will be able to see your personal access token and thus have access to your repo.
====

+
This gives Travis access to your public repos, so that Travis can automatically deploy your documentation files.
. In link:../deploy_github_pages.sh[`deploy_github_pages.sh`], change `GITHUB_REPO`'s value to your repo.
. This repo comes with a link:../.travis.yml[`.travis.yml`] that tells
Travis what to do. So there is no need for you to create one yourself.
. To see the CI in action, push a commit to the master branch!
.. Go to the repository and see the pushed commit. There should be an
icon which will link you to the Travis build.
image:images/build_pending.png[Commit build]
.. As the build is run on a provided remote machine, we can only examine
the logs it produces: image:images/travis_build.png[Travis build]
. If the build is successful, you should be able to check the coverage
details of the tests at http://coveralls.io/[Coveralls]
. For commits to the `master` branch, Travis automatically pushes generated HTML files of documentation to the `gh-pages` branch.
. Update the link to the 'build status' badge at the top of the
`README.md` to point to the build status of your own repo.

== Repository-wide checks

In addition to running Gradle checks, we also configure Travis CI to run
some repository-wide checks. Unlike the Gradle checks which only cover
files used in the build process, these repository-wide checks cover
_all_ files in the repository. They check for repository rules which are
hard to enforce on development machines such as line ending
requirements.

These checks are implemented as POSIX shell scripts, and thus can only
be run on POSIX-compliant operating systems such as macOS and Linux. To
run all checks locally on these operating systems, execute the following
in the repository root directory:

[source,shell]
----
./config/travis/run-checks.sh
----

Any warnings or errors will be printed out to the console.

== Implementing new checks

Checks are implemented as executable `check-*` scripts within the
`config/travis/` directory. The `run-checks.sh` script will
automatically pick up and run files named as such.

Check scripts should print out errors in the following format:

....
SEVERITY:FILENAME:LINE: MESSAGE
....

where `SEVERITY` is either `ERROR` or `WARN`, `FILENAME` is the path to
the file relative to the current directory, `LINE` is the line of the
file where the error occurred and `MESSAGE` is the message explaining
the error.

Check scripts must exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors occur.
