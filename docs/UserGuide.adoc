== Introduction

JitHub is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts, email, and calendar*. More importantly,
JitHub is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JitHub can get your daily tasks such as checking schedule done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JitHub.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
