== Introduction

JalilEnterprises is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for stock taking*. More importantly, JalilEnterprises is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB4 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/Arduino q/20 m/5 t/Lab1 t/Lab2` : adds 20 `Arduino` item to the StockList, with tags `Lab1` and `Lab2`.
* **`delete`**`n/Arduino q/20` : delete `20 Arduinos`.
* *`status`* : Shows the number of every item in each status category (Free, loan, faulty)

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
