== Introduction

TuitionConnect (TC) is personalised address book for the private home tutors. +

There are several features in TuitionConnect which aid in the management of your tutee contacts and tuition.
There are also features which supports the management of your personal contacts and tasks so that you do not require 2 different address books to handle his or her contacts and tasks. +

TuitionConnect is primarily for tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and tasks*.
More importantly, TuitionConnect is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +

With TuitionConnect's keyboard shortcuts and productive features, TuitionConnect can get your contact and task management done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested?
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
