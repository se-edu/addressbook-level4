== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: integrated *CalendarFX* into the application
** What it does: has a calendar that reflects all scheduling commands that the user inputs.
** Justification: This feature enhances the product significantly because it improves the user interface. For instance, readability of the schedule is better as user can view it for the year, month, week or day.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required integrations with existing commands and UI.
