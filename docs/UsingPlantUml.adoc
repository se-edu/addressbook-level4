== Introduction to PlantUML

PlantUML is a popular tool allowing users to create various diagrams through a
simple domain specific language.
For more information about the basics of PlantUML, head over to
link:http://plantuml.com/[its official website].

== Set up PlantUML

=== Installing Graphviz

Graphviz is a dependency that PlantUML requires to generate more advanced
diagrams. Head over to the https://www.graphviz.org/download/[downloads page] on
the offcial Graphviz website and follow instructions to install Graphviz.

=== Installing the `PlantUML integration` plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

While this is not compulsory, the `PlantUML integration` provides a live preview
of the PlantUML file you are working on.

.Settings - Plugins - Marketplace: install the `PlantUML integration` plugin

=== Configuring `PlantUML integration`

Go to `Settings` > `Other Settings` > `PlantUML` or search for PlantUML.
Configure the path to the `dot` executable.

.Settings - Other Settings - PlantUML: input the path to your dot executable

== Create/Edit PlantUML diagrams

After installing the `PlantUML integration` plugin, simply create or open any
`.puml` file to start editing it.

.Editing `DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml`

Any changes you make in editor pane on the left will be reflected in the
preview pane on the right.
However, do take note that these changes _will not_ be reflected in the
developers guide until you export the diagram.

== Export UML diagrams

A helpful Gradle task `:plantUml` is provided to generate all diagrams in the
`docs/diagrams` directory and output them in the `.png` format under
`docs/images` directory.

NOTE: You will have to `git add` any new diagrams generated!

When editing your documentation, you might find it useful to have Gradle monitor
changes to your PlantUML diagrams and and automatically export them. You can
do this by running `gradlew -t plantUml` in a terminal.

== Common tasks

=== Applying consistent formatting to PlantUML diagrams

It is highly recommended to consistently color your UML diagrams as an visual aid.
You can achieve this by creating a dictionary of colors and import it Ã  la CSS

For example, you can create a `Style.puml` with the contents

.Style.puml
[source]
----
...
'T1 and T2 are triadic colors.

!define LOGIC_COLOR #493DD1
!define LOGIC_COLOR_T1 #933DD1


!define LOGIC_COLOR_T2 #3D7BD1
...
----

and use it in another PlantUML file like this:

.UndoSequenceDiagram.puml
[source]
----
!include Style.puml

box Logic LOGIC_COLOR_T2
participant ":LogicManager" as LogicManager LOGIC_COLOR
participant ":AddressBookParser" as AddressBookParser LOGIC_COLOR
participant ":UndoCommand" as UndoCommand LOGIC_COLOR
end box
----

You can fine-tune the formatting of PlantUML diagrams with the `skinparam`
command.
For example, `skinparam backgroundColor transparent` turns the background of the
diagram transparent.

for a comprehensive list of ``skinparam``s head over to the
link:https://plantuml-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[unofficial
PlantUML skinparam documentation].

=== Repositioning elements in PlantUML diagrams

While PlantUML's automatic layout engine usually produces satisfactory results,
it is not uncommon to get a lemon, especially on larger diagrams.

NOTE: In most cases, you should consider decomposing the diagram into smaller
ones or focusing on a more specific portion of the diagram.

Here are some of the techniques you can use to coerce the layout engine to
obtain a more palatable diagram.

==== Link lengths
By default, a short link (`->`) points to right and a long link (`-->`)
points downwards. you can extend any link to make it longer (`-->`).

==== Link directions
Clever usage of arrow directions will resolve most layout issues.

C -right[hidden]- D

==== Reordering definitions
As a general rule of thumb, the layout engine will attempt to order symbols in
the order in which they are defined. If there is no formal definition, the
symbol is taken to be declared upon first usage.

We strongly recommend that you explicitly define all symbols to avoid any
potential layout mishaps.
