After studying this code and completing the corresponding exercises, you
should be able to,

toc::[]

== Use High-Level Designs `[LO-HighLevelDesign]`

Note how the link:DeveloperGuide.md#architecture[Developer Guide] describes the high-level design using an _Architecture Diagrams_ and high-level sequence diagrams.

== Use Event-Driven Programming `[LO-EventDriven]`

Note how the link:DeveloperGuide.md#architecture[Developer Guide] uses events to communicate with components without needing a direct coupling.
Also note how the `EventsCenter` class acts as an event dispatcher to facilitate communication between event creators and event consumers.

== Use API Design `[LO-ApiDesign]`

Note how components of AddressBook have well-defined APIs.
For example, the API of the `Logic` component is given in the link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]
image:LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


*Resources*

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un80XoRT1ME[A three-minutes video] of designing architecture of and discovering component APIs for a Game of Tic-Tac-Toe.


== Use Assertions `[LO-Assertions]`

Note how the AddressBook app uses Java `assert`s to verify assumptions.

*Resources*

* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html[Programming With Assertions] - a guide from Oracle.
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509082/eclipse-enable-assertions[How to enable assertions in Eclipse]

=== Exercise: Add more assertions

* Make sure assertions are enabled in Eclipse by forcing an assertion failure
  (e.g. add `assert false;` somewhere in the code and run the code to ensure the runtime reports an assertion failure).
* Add more assertions to AddressBook as you see fit.

== Use Logging `[LO-Logging]`

Note link:DeveloperGuide.md#31-logging[how the AddressBook app uses Java's `java.util.log` package to do logging].

*Resources*

* Tutorials
** http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-logging/index.html[Logging using java.util.logging] - a tutorial by Jakob Jenkov
** http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html[Logging tutorial] - a more detailed tutorial from Oracle.
* Logging best practices
** http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/guide.html#Message_PrioritiesLevels[Apache Commons Logging guide]
** https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/01/10-tips-proper-application-logging.html[10 Tips for Proper Application Logging]
** https://wiki.base22.com/display/btg/Java+Logging+Standards+and+Guidelines[Base 22 Java Logging Standards and Guidelines]

=== Exercise: Add more logging

Add more logging to AddressBook as you see fit.

== Use Defensive Coding `[LO-DefensiveCoding]`

Note how AddressBook uses the `ReadOnly*` interfaces to prevent objects being modified by clients who are not supposed to modify them.

=== Exercise: identify more places for defensive coding

Analyze the AddressBook code/design to identify,

* where defensive coding is used
* where the code can be more defensive

== Use Build Automation `[LO-BuildAutomation]`

Note <<UsingGradle#, how the AddressBook app uses Gradle to automate build tasks>>.

*Resources*

* Tutorials
** https://gradle.org/getting-started-gradle-java/[Getting started with Gradle (Java)] - a tutorial from the Gradle team
** http://www.tutorialspoint.com/gradle/[Another tutorial] - from TutorialPoint

=== Exercise: Use gradle to run tasks

* *Use gradle to do these tasks (instructions are <<UsingGradle#, here>>)*: +
  Run all tests in headless mode, build the jar file.

=== Exercise: Use gradle to manage dependencies

* Note how the build script `build.gradle` file manages third party dependencies such as ControlsFx. +
  Update that file to manage a third-party library dependency.

== Use Continuous Integration `[LO-ContinuousIntegration]`

Note <<UsingTravis#, how the AddressBook app uses Travis to perform Continuous Integration>>.
(https://travis-ci.org/se-edu/addressbook-level4[image:https://travis-ci.org/se-edu/addressbook-level4.svg?branch=master[Build Status]])

*Resources*

* Tutorials
** https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/[Getting started with Travis] - a tutorial from the Travis team

=== Exercise: Use Travis in your own project

* Set up Travis to perform CI on your own project.

== Use Code Coverage `[LO-CodeCoverage]`

Note how our CI server <<UsingTravis#, Travis uses Coveralls to report code coverage>>.
(https://coveralls.io/github/se-edu/addressbook-level4?branch=master[image:https://coveralls.io/repos/github/se-edu/addressbook-level4/badge.svg?branch=master[Coverage Status]])
After setting up Coveralls for your project, you can visit Coveralls website to find details about the coverage of code pushed to your repo.
https://coveralls.io/github/se-edu/addressbook-level4?branch=master[Here] is an example.

=== Exercise: Use EclEmma to measure coverage locally

* Install the http://www.eclemma.org/[EclEmma Eclipse Plugin] in your computer and use that to find code that is not covered by the tests.
This plugin can help you to find coverage details even before you push code to the remote repo.

== Apply Test Case Design Heuristics `[LO-TestCaseDesignHeuristics]`

The link:../src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/StringUtilTest.java[`StringUtilTest.java`] class gives some examples of how to use __Equivalence Partitions__, __Boundary Value Analysis__, and _Test Input Combination Heuristics_ to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of test cases testing the link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util/StringUtil.java[`StringUtil.java`] class.

=== Exercise: Apply Test Case Design Heuristics to other places

* Find answers to these questions:
** What is an Equivalence Partition? How does it help to improve E&E of testing?
** What is Boundary Value Analysis? How does it help to improve E&E of testing?
** What are the heuristics that can be used when combining multiple test inputs?
* Use the test case design heuristics mentioned above to improve test cases in other places.

== Write Integration Tests `[LO-IntegrationTests]`

Consider the link:../src/test/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManagerTest.java[`StorageManagerTest.java`] class.

* Test methods `prefsReadSave()` and `addressBookReadSave()` are integration tests.
  Note how they simply test if The `StorageManager` class is correctly wired to its dependencies.
* Test method `handleAddressBookChangedEvent_exceptionThrown_eventRaised()` is a unit
test because it uses _dependency injection_ to isolate the SUT `StorageManger::handleAddressBookChangedEvent(...)` from its dependencies.

Compare the above with link:../src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/LogicManagerTest.java[`LogicManagerTest`].
Many of the tests in that class (e.g. `execute_add_*` methods) tests are neither integration nor unit tests.
They are a _integration + unit_ tests because they not only checks if the LogicManager is correctly
wired to its dependencies, but also checks the working of its dependencies.
For example, the following two lines test the the `LogicManager` but also the `Parser`.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void execute_add_invalidArgsFormat() throws Exception {
    ...
    assertCommandBehavior("add Valid Name 12345 e/valid@email.butNoPhonePrefix a/valid, address", expectedMessage);
    assertCommandBehavior("add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix a/valid, address", expectedMessage);
    ...
}
----

=== Exercise: Write unit and integration tests for the same method.

* Write a unit test for a a high-level methods somewhere in the code base.
* Write an integration test for the same method.

== Perform System Testing `[LO-SystemTesting]`

Note how tests below `src/test/java/guitests` package (e.g link:../src/test/java/guitests/AddCommandTest.java[`AddCommandTest.java`]) are system tests because they test the entire system end-to-end.

=== Exercise: Write more system tests

* Add some more system tests to the existing system tests.

== Automate GUI Testing `[LO-AutomateGuiTesting]`

Note how this project uses TextFX library to automate GUI testing,
including link:DeveloperGuide.md#headless-gui-testing[_headless_ GUI testing].

=== Exercise: Write more automated GUI tests

* Add some more automated GUI tests.

== Apply Design Patterns `[LO-DesignPatterns]`

Here are some example design patterns used in the code base.

* *Singleton Pattern* :
  link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/EventsCenter.java[`EventsCenter.java`] is Singleton class.
  Its single instance can be accessed using the `EventsCenter.getInsance()` method.
* *Facade Pattern* :
  link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager.java`]
  is not only shielding the internals of the Storage component from outsiders,
  it is mostly redirecting methods calls to its internal components
  (i.e. minimal logic in the class itself).
  Therefore, `StorageManager` can be considered a Facade class.
* *Command Pattern* :
  The link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command.java`] and its sub classes implement the Command Pattern.
* *Observer Pattern* :
  The link:DeveloperGuide.md#events-driven-nature-of-the-design[event driven mechanism] used by this code base employs the Observer pattern. +
  For example, objects that are interested in events need to have the `@Subscribe` annotation in the class (this is similar to implementing an `\<<Observer>>` interface) and register with the `EventsCenter`.
  When something noteworthy happens, an event is raised and the `EventsCenter` notifies all relevant subscribers.
  Unlike in the Observer pattern in which the `\<<Observerable>>` class is notifying all `\<<Observer>>` objects, here the `\<<Observable>>` classes simply raises an event and the `EventsCenter` takes care of the notifications.
* *MVC Pattern* :
** The 'View' part of the application is mostly in the `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
** `Model` component contains the 'Model'.
** Sub classes of link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UiPart.java[`UiPart`]
  (e.g. `PersonListPanel` ) act as 'Controllers',
  each controlling some part of the UI
  and communicating with the 'Model' via a `Logic` component
  which sits between the 'Controller' and the 'Model'.
* *Abstraction Occurrence Pattern* : Not currently used in the app.

=== Exercise: Discover other possible applications of the patterns

* Find other possible applications of the patterns to improve the current design.
  e.g. where else in the design can you apply the Singleton pattern?
* Discuss pros and cons of applying the pattern in each of the situations you found in the previous step.

=== Exercise: Find more applicable patterns

* Learn other _Gang of Four_ Design patterns to see if they are applicable to the app.

== Use Static Analysis `[LO-StaticAnalysis]`

Note how this project uses the http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/[CheckStyle] static analysis tool to
confirm compliance with the coding standard.

Other popular Java static analysis tools:

* http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/[Find Bugs]
* https://pmd.github.io/[PMD]

=== Exercise: Use the CheckStyle Eclipse plugin

* Install the http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/#!/[CheckStyle Eclipse plugin] and use it to detect coding standard violations.

== Do Code Reviews `[LO-CodeReview]`

* Note how some PRs in this project have been reviewed by other developers.
  Here is an https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/147[example].
* Also note how we have used https://www.codacy.com[Codacy] to do automate some part of the code review workload (https://www.codacy.com/app/damith/addressbook-level4?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=se-edu/addressbook-level4&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade[image:https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fc0b7775cf7f4fdeaf08776f3d8e364a[Codacy Badge]])

Here are some things you can comment on when reviewing code:

* Read the code from the perspective of a new developer.
  Identify parts that are harder to understand and suggest improvements.
* Point out any coding standard violations.
* Suggest better names for methods/variables/classes.
* Point out unnecessary code duplications.
* Check if the comments, docs, tests have been updated to match the code change.
* Check for violation of relevant principles such as the SOLID principles.
* Point out where SLAP can be improved. e.g. methods that are too long or has too deep nesting.
* Suggest any other code quality improvements.
