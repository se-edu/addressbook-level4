'''

== Use High-Level Designs `[LO-HighLevelDesign]`

Note how the <<DeveloperGuide#architecture, Developer Guide>> describes the high-level design using an _Architecture Diagrams_ and high-level sequence diagrams.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/architecture/[se-edu/se-book: Design: Architecture]
* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/design/introduction/multilevelDesign/[se-edu/se-book: Design: Introduction: Multi-Level Design]

'''

== Use Event-Driven Programming `[LO-EventDriven]`

Note how the <<DeveloperGuide#architecture, Developer Guide>> uses events to communicate with components without needing a direct coupling. Also note how the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/index/EventsCenter.java[`EventsCenter.java`] acts as an event dispatcher to facilitate communication between event creators and event consumers.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/architecture/architecturalStyles/eventDriven/[se-edu/se-book: Design: Architecture: Architecture Styles: Event-Driven Architectural Style]

'''

== Use API Design `[LO-ApiDesign]`

Note how components of AddressBook have well-defined APIs. For example, the API of the `Logic` component is given in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]
image:LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/reuse/apis/[se-edu/se-book: Implementation: Reuse: APIs]

'''

== Use Assertions `[LO-Assertions]`

Note how the AddressBook app uses Java ``assert``s to verify assumptions.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/errorHandling/assertions/[se-edu/se-book: Implementation: Error Handling: Assertions]

=== Exercise: Add more assertions

* Make sure assertions are enabled in your IDE by forcing an assertion failure (e.g. add `assert false;` somewhere in the code and run the code to ensure the runtime reports an assertion failure).
* Add more assertions to AddressBook as you see fit.


'''

== Use Logging `[LO-Logging]`

Note <<DeveloperGuide#logging, how the AddressBook app uses Java's `java.util.log` package to do logging>>.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/errorHandling/logging/[se-edu/se-book: Implementation: Error Handling: Logging]

=== Exercise: Add more logging

Add more logging to AddressBook as you see fit.


'''

== Use Defensive Coding `[LO-DefensiveCoding]`

Note how AddressBook uses the `ReadOnly*` interfaces to prevent objects being modified by clients who are not supposed to modify them.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/errorHandling/defensiveProgramming/[se-edu/se-book: Implementation: Error Handling: Defensive Programming]

=== Exercise: identify more places for defensive coding

Analyze the AddressBook code/design to identify,

* where defensive coding is used
* where the code can be more defensive

'''

== Use Build Automation `[LO-BuildAutomation]`

Note <<UsingGradle#, how the AddressBook app uses Gradle to automate build tasks>>.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/integration/buildAutomation/what/[se-edu/se-book: Implementation: Integration: Build Automation: What]

=== Exercise: Use gradle to run tasks

* Use gradle to do these tasks: Run all tests in headless mode, build the jar file.

=== Exercise: Use gradle to manage dependencies

* Note how the build script `build.gradle` file manages third party dependencies such as ControlsFx. Update that file to manage a third-party library dependency.


'''

== Use Continuous Integration `[LO-ContinuousIntegration]`

Note <<UsingTravis#, how the AddressBook app uses Travis to perform Continuous Integration>>. (https://travis-ci.org/se-edu/addressbook-level4[image:https://travis-ci.org/se-edu/addressbook-level4.svg?branch=master[Build Status]])

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/integration/buildAutomation/continuousIntegrationDeployment/[se-edu/se-book: Implementation: Integration: Build Automation: CI & CD]

=== Exercise: Use Travis in your own project

* Set up Travis to perform CI on your own fork.


'''

== Use Code Coverage `[LO-CodeCoverage]`

Note how our CI server <<UsingTravis#, Travis uses Coveralls to report code coverage>>. (https://coveralls.io/github/se-edu/addressbook-level4?branch=master[image:https://coveralls.io/repos/github/se-edu/addressbook-level4/badge.svg?branch=master[Coverage Status]]) After <<UsingCoveralls#, setting up Coveralls>> for your project, you can visit Coveralls website to find details about the coverage of code pushed to your repo. https://coveralls.io/github/se-edu/addressbook-level4?branch=master[Here] is an example.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/testing/testCoverage/[se-edu/se-book: QA: Testing: Test Coverage]

=== Exercise: Use the IDE to measure coverage locally

* Use the IDE to measure code coverage of your tests.

'''

== Apply Test Case Design Heuristics `[LO-TestCaseDesignHeuristics]`

The link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/StringUtilTest.java[`StringUtilTest.java`]
class gives some examples of how to use _Equivalence Partitions_, _Boundary Value Analysis_, and _Test Input Combination Heuristics_ to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of test cases testing the link:../src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util/StringUtil.java[`StringUtil.java`] class.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/testCaseDesign/[se-edu/se-book: QA: Test Case Design]

=== Exercise: Apply Test Case Design Heuristics to other places

* Use the test case design heuristics mentioned above to improve test cases in other places.

'''

== Write Integration Tests `[LO-IntegrationTests]`

Consider the link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManagerTest.java[`StorageManagerTest.java`] class.

* Test methods `prefsReadSave()` and `addressBookReadSave()` are integration tests. Note how they simply test if The `StorageManager` class is correctly wired to its dependencies.
* Test method `handleAddressBookChangedEvent_exceptionThrown_eventRaised()` is a unit test because it uses _dependency injection_ to isolate the SUT `StorageManager#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(...)` from its dependencies.

Compare the above with link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/LogicManagerTest.java[`LogicManagerTest`]. Some of the tests in that class (e.g. `execute_*` methods) are neither integration nor unit tests. They are _integration + unit_ tests because they not only check if the LogicManager is correctly wired to its dependencies, but also checks the working of its dependencies. For example, the following two lines test the `LogicManager` but also the `Parser`.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void execute_invalidCommandFormat_throwsParseException() {
    ...
    assertParseException(invalidCommand, MESSAGE_UNKNOWN_COMMAND);
    assertHistoryCorrect(invalidCommand);
}
----

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/testing/testingTypes/[se-edu/se-book: QA: Testing: Testing Types]

=== Exercise: Write unit and integration tests for the same method.

* Write a unit test for a high-level method somewhere in the code base (or a new method you wrote).
* Write an integration test for the same method.

'''

== Write System Tests `[LO-SystemTesting]`

Note how tests below `src/test/java/systemtests` package (e.g link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddCommandSystemTest.java[`AddCommandSystemTest.java`]) are system tests because they test the entire system end-to-end.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/testing/testingTypes/[se-edu/se-book: QA: Testing: Testing Types]

=== Exercise: Write more system tests

* Write system tests for the new features you add.

'''

== Automate GUI Testing `[LO-AutomateGuiTesting]`

Note how this project uses TextFX library to automate GUI testing, including <<DeveloperGuide#headless-gui-testing, _headless_ GUI testing>>.

=== Exercise: Write more automated GUI tests

* Covered by `[LO-SystemTesting]`

'''

== Apply Design Patterns `[LO-DesignPatterns]`

Here are some example design patterns used in the code base.

* *Singleton Pattern* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/EventsCenter.java[`EventsCenter.java`] is Singleton class. Its single instance can be accessed using the `EventsCenter.getInstance()` method.
* *Facade Pattern* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager.java`] is not only shielding the internals of the Storage component from outsiders, it is mostly redirecting method calls to its internal components (i.e. minimal logic in the class itself). Therefore, `StorageManager` can be considered a Facade class.
* *Command Pattern* : The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command.java`] and its sub classes implement the Command Pattern.
* *Observer Pattern* : The <<DeveloperGuide#events-driven-nature-of-the-design, event driven mechanism>> used by this code base employs the Observer pattern. For example, objects that are interested in events need to have the `@Subscribe` annotation in the class (this is similar to implementing an `\<<Observer>>` interface) and register with the `EventsCenter`. When something noteworthy happens, an event is raised and the `EventsCenter` notifies all relevant subscribers. Unlike in the Observer pattern in which the `\<<Observable>>` class is notifying all `\<<Observer>>` objects, here the `\<<Observable>>` classes simply raises an event and the `EventsCenter` takes care of the notifications.
* *MVC Pattern* :
** The 'View' part of the application is mostly in the `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
** `Model` component contains the 'Model'. However, note that it is possible to view the `Logic` as the model because it hides the `Model` behind it and the view has to go through the `Logic` to access the `Model`.
** Sub classes of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UiPart.java[`UiPart`] (e.g. `PersonListPanel` ) act as 'Controllers', each controlling some part of the UI and communicating with the 'Model' (via the `Logic` component which sits between the 'Controller' and the 'Model').
* *Abstraction Occurrence Pattern* : Not currently used in the app.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/designPatterns/[se-edu/se-book: Design: Design Patterns]

=== Exercise: Discover other possible applications of the patterns

* Find other possible applications of the patterns to improve the current design. e.g. where else in the design can you apply the Singleton pattern?
* Discuss pros and cons of applying the pattern in each of the situations you found in the previous step.

=== Exercise: Find more applicable patterns

* Learn other _Gang of Four_ Design patterns to see if they are applicable to the app.

'''

== Use Static Analysis `[LO-StaticAnalysis]`

Note how this project uses the http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/[CheckStyle] static analysis tool to confirm compliance with the coding standard.

*Resources*

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/qualityAssurance/staticAnalysis/[se-edu/se-book: QA: Static Analysis]

=== Exercise: Use CheckStyle locally to check style compliance

* Install the CheckStyle plugin for your IDE and use it to check compliance of your code with our style rules (given in `/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`).

'''

== Do Code Reviews `[LO-CodeReview]`

* Note how some PRs in this project have been reviewed by other developers. Here is an https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/147[example].
* Also note how we have used https://www.codacy.com[Codacy] to do automate some part of the code review workload (https://www.codacy.com/app/damith/addressbook-level4?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=se-edu/addressbook-level4&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade[image:https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fc0b7775cf7f4fdeaf08776f3d8e364a[Codacy Badge]])
