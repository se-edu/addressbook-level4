https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] is an all-in-one hosting platform for deploying and automating modern static websites.
Furthermore, with the aid of build tools such as Gradle, Netlify provides a smoother experience for continuous deployment.
One of the ways this can be done is by using Netlify's https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/[Deploy Previews]
feature, which allows previewing of changes to documentation whenever a pull request is made.

== Setting up Netlify

+
.  Go to https://www.netlify.com/ and click `Sign Up`. Then click `GITHUB SIGN IN` and enter your GitHub account details if needed.

and build your documentation.
