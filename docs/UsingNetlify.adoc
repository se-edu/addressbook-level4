https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] is an automated hosting platform for deploying static websites. With the aid of build tools such as Gradle, Netlify provides a smoother experience for previewing documentation. This can be done by using Netlify's https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/[Deploy Previews] feature, which shows a preview of the updated documentation whenever a pull request is made.

== Setting up Netlify
