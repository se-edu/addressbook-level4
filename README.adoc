* This is a desktop CG Stock Taking application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for CG lab managers searching for experiment apparatus.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
