* This is a desktop Address Book + something else application. Most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface) but we have includede a GUI to make the application aesthetically appealing.
* It is a Java application intended for computing personnels to make their lives simpler by typing on their comman line instead of using a cursor.
* The original addressbook application provides a *reasonably well-written* code example. We hope we don't screw it up.
* What's different from the original https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Adressbook]:
** Humors are added currently.
